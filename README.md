# Albatrius
I took this project from a book called Python Crash Course: A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming.

It's a game called alien inavsion,I call it Albatrius I changed the games stroy slightly,the is ship SpaceX's Starship
which can fire bullets to destory aliens ships, they are against Elons goal to make humans multiplanetary species,
if you destory all alien ships Mars will be ours
